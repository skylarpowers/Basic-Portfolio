	<p>I grew up in the growing age of technology and I love it. There has never been a time in my life that technology has not advanced in anyway. Knowing that I could be apart of that is awesome. I learned the basics of html and css on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">www.codeacademy.com</a>. Since then I have feel in love with the concept and being able to learn new things everyday. Some days I struggle with a new thing or even something I previously learned, but after doing this for about 6 months you know it's all about trial and error. Anything and everything I do will be on here, so make sure to check it out!</p>
